# My Quiz

## Description

We've been tasked with creating a coding quiz from scratch following a certain criteria;

- Added html/css/js + highScore versions
- Start button / removal of start button when clicked
- timer starts when start button is pressed
- presented with a question when start button is pressed
- if question answered incorrectly a -5s penalty is subtracted from timer
- once all questioned are answered the game is over
- when game over is displayed, your prompted to input your name to be added to highScores
- highScore is clearable with clear button
- on highScore page has a go back button to home page

## Todo

Left todo;

- I would of liked to fully render the highScore table on highScore page from local storage.
